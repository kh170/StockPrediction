tqdm

To run the codes:
1.For each model, please access the respective folders.
2.Run the codes in jupyter notebook
3.Input the location of data in the "path" variable
4.Input the location where you want the results to print in "rpath" variable
5.Run the codes for each model 
6.For the comparison analysis, run the hmm code implementation

Folder details:
Data: Contains the Netflix dataset
Data analysis: Data analyzed and moving average used for prediction
HMM: Contains the code for hmm implementation and the comparison between the three models
Basic RNN: Contains the code for simpleRNN implementation 
LSTM: Contains the code for LSTM implementation 
Results: Contains the prediction from all the three models.
